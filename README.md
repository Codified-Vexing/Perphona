# Perphona
Yet another music player and manager app selecting and combining the features I enjoy from other such apps.
This project was started as I was learning to program with for GTK3+ interfaces.
The program files will mention files of music titles which I won't be including to avoid licensing issues. These are there because it's what I used to test the program.
This application should probably have a big refactoring, but whatever.
